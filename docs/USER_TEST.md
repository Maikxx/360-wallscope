# User test

We performed a user test with a medical student, who is currently studying at the University of Amsterdam. He studies biomedical sciences, so he was a good fit for our user group. The person being tested was 21 years old at the moment of the test, busy writing his thesis.

## Perceptions

_Assumptions to go to the user from the home page._
-> "The plus I'm guessing" - the user isn't quite sure about this!
-> Expect user settings to be in settings and not on profile itself.

_Does he know how to add a board?_
-> Just looking at clicking may add zero state to linking data sets or articles.
-> Removing a link isn't easy yet! "How do you remove them?"

## Feedback

Quite a clear way to work with. Definitely a good way to find and link data.

It is useful to be able to link things together or to have to save or print things yourself in different folders. This way you have a different view at a glance.

Indicate what the link is at a hover.
Unclear because there was no real data in it.
Finding it easier to work on a computer, but it's nice that it's available everywhere.
Working from home or university. Lives in Amsterdam and doesn't have to travel.
but working from home is easier, but in a group on the uni.

Definitely useful for collaborating, so you don't have to create multiple boards and then compare them again.

The types of links are correct, and these different links are actually used in the research.

Looks in real life for articles also download them as pdf, but must remember where they are.
Does it use the NCBI? - unclear website.

It is difficult to tell the difference between parts of articles, and wants to highlight some important things, because it has to be written out right now.
**Highlights** - Create automatic summary.

Design is very dark, but not too dark. Could possibly use a light mode.
Most of the sites that he is used to now are light.
Usually works in the afternoon on his research, but tries to keep evenings free.
Once every two weeks he works during the evening and night.
For daytime it is too sober.
Uses dark mode, but turns it off during the day.
